## Challenge: Improve your game
Can you think of ways to improve your game? For example, you could create special dots that:

+ Double your score?
+ Slow down the dots?
+ Hide all the other dots on the screen?

Could you add a menu with buttons to your game? You could add an instructions screen or a separate screen for showing the high score.
