## Introduction

In this project you'll learn how to create a game, in which you have to match up coloured dots with the correct part of the controller.

--- no-print ---
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to rotate the controller and catch the flying dots as they reach the centre. Miss three dots and the game is over.
