This is how you need to change the code for the blue sprite:

If you play the game now, you can see that the dots sometimes get created one top of each other.

Change the code for the 'yellow' dot sprite so that it waits four seconds after the flag is clicked before appearing.

Then change the code for the 'blue' dot sprite so that it waits 6 seconds after the flag is clicked before appearing.
