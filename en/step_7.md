## Challenge: Faster moving dots
Can you improve your game by adding a `speed`{:class="blockdata"} variable, so that the dots start off moving 1 step at a time, and steadily get faster and faster? This will work in a very similar way to the `delay`{:class="blockdata"} variable used above, and you can use this code to help you.
